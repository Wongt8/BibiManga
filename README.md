*Bibi = library*

My first project using the framework **Symfony**. The main goal of this project is to see what is possible with Symfony and to practice.


## Introduction
I have a big collection of manga so I decide why not to put all my manga in a databases and use it to make a web site, where I can see all my manga, all the money that I have lost
and also the mangas that I haven't read yet. <br>
For the moment this project is not very useful for other people than me, but maybe I will add a connexion page and make people add they one library

</br>

### Requirements
